In server.js\r\n```\r\napp.listen(3000); // change 3000 to port you want to serve at\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. In assets/js/chattabox.js\r\n```\r\nvar socket = io.connect(' http://example.com:3000 '); // use your domain name and the port from previous step\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Directions:\r\n\r\nSuccessfully install Node.js and Redis\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_root\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:ericreinsmidt/chattabox.git\r\n$ cd chattabox\r\n$ npm install -d\r\n$ redis-server\r\n$ node server.js\r\n```\r\nOpen a browser and point it to http://example.com:3000\r\n\r\n> Copyright (c) 2012 Eric Reinsmidt\r\n\r\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
